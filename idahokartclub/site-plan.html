      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>If you are or know somebody who wants to find other Mario Kart players in Idaho, then I present this website to you. This website will inform the user that there are other people in Idaho who have this interest and that there are opportunities for them to make new friends through this classic video game series. What if I do not want to be social, you may ask. If that is the case, then perhaps you can use this website to improve your Mario Kart skills and learn new techniques from other website users.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience for this website would be young adults in Idaho who like playing Mario Kart and wish to find new social opportunities. While Mario Kart attracts a wide audience of people, I want to get the attention of college age adults who want to find others that share their interests. Since I am specifically targeting one state, gathering people for events will be much less complicated and people who want to go to them will not have to travel as far as they otherwise would.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <p>
        <b>Header and Footer</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        There will be a header and a footer that are the same on every page of the website. The header will contain the website's logo as well as a row with links to every page. Clicking the logo will also likely act as a quick link to the home page. The footer will show the name of the website's creator as well as a row of buttons that would link to different social media pages. The buttons would use icons that indicate which social media the button is being linked to.
      </p>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <b>What is the Idaho Mario Kart Club?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be a paragraph that explains what the website is about. Written content would include who started the club, the reason why the club was created, and the ways in which the reader could benefit from using the website. There will be brief explanations of each subpage on the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Signup Section</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be the section of the page where the user would be able to go to a signup page that would allow them to create a request to join the club. It will have some text, "Ready to Join the Club?" for example, and a button that would be the link to the signup page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Additional Content</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the minor sections of the page will be targeted more to the website users who are already members of the club. There will be a leaderboard showing notable in-game statistics of the most skilled members of the club. This will include topics such as the players with the fastest Time Trials times and the players with the most victories. There will also be an advertisement for a subsection of the club called the "Roy Enjoyers Association", a gathering of individuals who prefer to play as Roy over any other character in Mario Kart.

      <h3>Insights & Activities</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Mario Kart 101</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be a paragraph or possibly multiple paragraphs that describe the basic information that anyone would need to know in preparation of getting started with Mario Kart. Aspects of this content would include an introduction of Mario Kart itself, an explanation of how the game is played, and possibly even some helpful information that would prevent any beginners from being confused by the game's mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Daily Word Search</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be one of the main activities that viewers of the websites can participate in. It is a word search puzzle that uses words or phrases that are related to Mario Kart as well as the Idaho Mario Kart Club. This section may even include additional information, such as the name of the first individual to complete the previous activity or prizes that could be earned by being the quickest to submit an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Weekly Trivia</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be an extra section near the bottom of the page that will entertain the reader with fun and humorous facts about Mario Kart. Fun facts are usually an effective way for readers to keep their minds active and gain further appreciation for the games and the extensive work that was put into them. If the facts have to do with gameplay, they may even play the game specifically to see if the information that was given is really true.

      <h3>Event Schedule</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Disclaimer</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        While most of the content of the page will exist within the next section, I believe that it would be effective to include a paragraph that provides the reader with information that they would need to know before looking into attending any of the club's events. Some of the this information would include age requirements, rules for hygiene and behavior, and whether attendees would need to bring their own controllers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Upcoming Events</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        This section will contain the main content for the page, which is the schedule that lists all of the major club events that members could potentially attend. For each event, there would be a time and date listed, as well as a location in Idaho, and the specific game that is being played at the event. With this information, there may be links to external resources that provide the reader with more details about the specific location, game, and possibly costs and other requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Don't Live Near Any of These Places?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Near the bottom of the page, there will be a section for readers who feel that they could not participate in any of the listed events on the page. In this section, the issue will be addressed with a button that would send them to another page where they would be able to submit a request for a more appropriate location for them. Having this feature would allow the club to cater more to its members and their specific needs.
